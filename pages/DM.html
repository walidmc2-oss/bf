            <h2>The Unbroken Chain of Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
              In Bhakti Yoga, knowledge is received through the 'Guru
              Parampara,' an unbroken disciplic succession of spiritual masters.
              This ensures the purity and potency of the teachings, passed down
              directly from the Supreme Lord through authentic representatives.
              Understanding this lineage is crucial for grasping the depth and
              authenticity of the path.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.
              Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The
              self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has
              seen the truth." <br />- Bhagavad-gita 4.34

            <h2>His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Asraya Kesava Maharaja</h2>
            <p>
              Srila Bhakti Asraya Keshava Maharaja is a native to New Zealand
              and appeared in this world in Invercargill in 1967. At the young
              age of 17 he quickly developed attraction to the path of Bhakti
              and joined with the Vaisnava tradition in 1985, under the
              teachings of Srila AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaja Prabhupada. For
              10 years he lived in ashrams and travelled throughout the world
              receiving vital lessons on the path of Bhakti (Vedanta) by various
              teachers and well-wishers, he also lectured and taught in numerous
              ashrams around the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1995 he met his eternal Master Om Vishnupada Srila Bhakti
              Sundar Govinda Maharaja and received Harinama initiation, then in
              1997 Diksha Gayatri mantra from his Gurudev personally in
              Navadwipa, India. For many years he was assisting his Gurudev's
              mission in the UK, Ireland, India and Sweden.
            </p>
            <p>
              In October 2012 Srila Keshava Maharaja entered into the sacred
              order of Sannyasa. Although in separation from his beloved Master,
              the attempt to try to serve in separation became an inevitable
              inspiration for Him to enter the renounced order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Srila Keshava Maharaja is currently based in New Zealand and
              Australia and is friend and teacher to an international community
              of students. Srila Keshava Maharaja is our initiating Guru and
              founder of The Bhakti Field Foundation. The aim of our mission is
              to further expand the Divine path of Bhakti Yoga, as revealed and
              taught by Srila Govinda Maharaja, Srila Sridhar Maharaja & Srila
              Swami Maharaja Prabhupada.

              As the chosen successor of Srila Sridhar Maharaj, Srila Bhakti
              Sundar Govinda Maharaj dedicated his life to his Guru's service
              from the tender age of seventeen. Known for his loving,
              affectionate nature and dynamic preaching style, he traveled the
              world extensively, establishing over fifty centers and inspiring
              thousands of people in the practice of Bhakti Yoga. Foreseeing the
              need for a guiding light, Srila Sridhar Maharaj appointed him as
              his successor to ensure the mission's continuation. After his
              Guru's departure in 1988, Srila Govinda Maharaj carried the sweet
              nectar of those teachings around the world with his loving,
              affectionate nature. Acclaimed by his own spiritual master as his
              "most precious gem," his grace continues to nourish devotees
              worldwide. He carried the legacy of his spiritual master with
              great charm, warmth, and dignity.

              His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj
            </h2>
            <p>
              His Divine Grace Sri Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami
              Maharaj, the founder of the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, was born
              in India in 1895, in a respected Brahmana family of the
              Bhattacarya order, at Hapaniya, District Burdwan, West Bengal. He
              received his education at Baharamapur University. Having taken his
              pious birth in Sri Gauda-Mandal, the holy lands where Sri
              Chaitanya Mahaprabhu exhibited His divine pastimes on this earth,
              Srila Sridhar Maharaj, from his very childhood, had a natural
              affinity for the mission of Sri Chaitanya Sankirtan - the Grand
              Congregational Chanting of the Holy Names of the Supreme Lord. In
              1926, Srila Sridhar Maharaj joined the Sri Gaudiya Math, and
              became an initiated disciple of its founder, the illustrious Srila
              Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur Goswami Prabhupad (1874-1937).
              He later accepted the holy order of sannyasa in 1930. Recognizing
              him as a faithful stalwart preacher of the perfect precepts of
              Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad
              conferred upon him the name "Sri Bhakti Rakshak," which means
              "Guardian of Devotion". A highly respected scholar and revered
              Gaudiya Vaishnava saint, Srila Sridhar Maharaj was the dear most
              intimate godbrother of Srila Prabhupada. He founded the Sri
              Chaitanya Saraswat Math in Nabadwip, West Bengal. he travelled
              extensively throughout India and preached fluently in Bengali,
              Hindi, Sanskrit, and English, spreading the teachings of Sri
              Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on many levels in universities, public
              seminars, and Sankirtan festivals. Known for his deep
              philosophical insights and poetic realizations, he provided
              profound guidance and inspiration to devotees from around the
              world, emphasizing the sweet, intimate aspects of devotion.

            <h2>His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura</h2>
            <p>
              A towering intellectual and spiritual giant of the early 20th
              century, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura was the beloved
              spiritual master of Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. He
              was a powerful preacher who revitalized the Gaudiya Vaishnava
              tradition in India by establishing the Gaudiya Math, with
              sixty-four branches throughout the country. His mission was to
              spread the teachings of Lord Chaitanya with great vigor and
              scholarship, countering misunderstandings of the philosophy.

            <h2>His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</h2>
            <p>
              Born in Calcutta, India in 1896, His Divine Grace A. C.
              Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada became a formally initiated
              disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami in 1933. His
              spiritual master encouraged him to spread Vedic knowledge in
              English, a mission Prabhupada embraced. Founder-Acharya of the
              International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Srila
              Prabhupada played a pivotal role in bringing Bhakti Yoga to the
              Western world. He translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic
              scriptures into the English language, making their profound wisdom
              accessible to millions worldwide and establishing a global
              spiritual movement.

            <h2>His Divine Grace Srila Gaura Kisora Dasa Babaji</h2>
            <p>
              Srila Gaura Kisora Dasa Babaji was the spiritual master of Srila
              Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. He was a great renunciate and a
              pure, realized soul who was completely absorbed in devotional
              service. Although he was illiterate, his spiritual wisdom was
              profound. He lived a life of extreme austerity and humility in
              Navadvipa, avoiding worldly association and constantly chanting
              the holy names. His life serves as a powerful example of pure,
              unalloyed devotion. Despite being illiterate, he was considered
              vastly learned and self-realized. He became the spiritual master
              of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, a pivotal figure in
              the Gaudiya Matha tradition. Babaji Maharaja's teachings
              emphasized the sole importance of chanting the holy name for
              realizing the Supreme Lord and warned against material
              distractions, even refusing an offer for eye treatment in
              Calcutta, stating he would never go to the material world.

            <h2>His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur</h2>
            <p>
              A crucial pioneer and spiritual reformer, Srila Bhakti Vinod
              Thakur is revered as the father of the modern Krishna
              consciousness movement. In the 19th century, at a time when the
              pure teachings of Lord Chaitanya were obscured, he worked
              tirelessly as a government magistrate by day and a prolific
              writer, poet, and preacher by night. He authored over one hundred
              books, composed hundreds of devotional songs (bhajans), and
              rediscovered the long-lost birthplace of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
              in Mayapur. His efforts laid the essential groundwork for his son,
              Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, to expand the mission globally.
              He received a robust education, excelling in English and Bengali
              literature. His intellectual pursuits led him to compare various
              theologies, initially finding Christian thought more appealing
              than Hindu monism. However, a pivotal spiritual awakening led him
              to deeply embrace and propagate Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's pure
              Vaishnava philosophy. Notably, he was the father and spiritual
              mentor of Bimala Prasada (later Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
              Prabhupada), a child he considered a divine blessing to spread Sri
              Chaitanya's message globally. Bhaktivinoda Thakura's life was a
              harmonious blend of devoted scholarship, administrative acumen,
              and unwavering commitment to the pure teachings of Krishna
              Consciousness, leaving an indelible mark on the Vaishnava
              tradition.
